# Pandas Salaries Data Analysis using Numpy and Pandas

This project demonstrates a basic data analysis workflow using **NumPy** and **Pandas** to explore a salary dataset. It is designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to data wrangling, data cleaning, and basic analysis in Python.

## 📊 Project Overview

The project focuses on performing various operations and analyses on a dataset of employee salaries. The analysis covers:

- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning
- Summary statistics
- Data filtering and selection
- Grouping and aggregation
- Insights extraction

This is a great example for students or new data analysts to learn how to explore and analyze real-world data using Python’s most popular data science libraries.

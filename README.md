# Pandas Salaries Data Analysis using Numpy and Pandas

This project demonstrates a basic data analysis workflow using **NumPy** and **Pandas** to explore a salary dataset. It is designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to data wrangling, data cleaning, and basic analysis in Python.

## 📊 Project Overview

The project focuses on performing various operations and analyses on a dataset of employee salaries. The analysis covers:

- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning
- Summary statistics
- Data filtering and selection
- Grouping and aggregation
- Insights extraction

This is a great example for students or new data analysts to learn how to explore and analyze real-world data using Python’s most popular data science libraries.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

## 📁 Files

- `Salaries.csv` — The dataset used in the analysis.
- `Salaries Data Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step analysis.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/Pandas-Salaries-Data-Analysis-using-Numpy-and-Pandas.git
cd Pandas-Salaries-Data-Analysis-using-Numpy-and-Pandas
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy jupyter

### 3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook "Salaries Data Analysis.ipynb"

## 📈 Sample Insights
The notebook explores and answers several questions, such as:

- What is the average base pay?
- Who has the highest overtime pay?
- What are the most common job titles?
- How does a job title correlate with salary?
- How many unique job titles exist?

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
By working through this notebook, you will learn:

How to manipulate CSV data with Pandas

How to use NumPy for numerical operations

Techniques for basic data analysis and visualization

Insights extraction from tabular data
